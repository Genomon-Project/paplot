# Summary

We introduce paplot, the software for generating dynamic reports that are frequently necessary in the post analyticalphases of cancer genome studies. 
The "interactive" nature of the paplot-generated reportsenables users to extract much richer information than that obtained from static graphs via most conventional visualization tools.
